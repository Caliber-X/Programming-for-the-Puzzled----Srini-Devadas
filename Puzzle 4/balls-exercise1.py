#Programming for the Puzzled -- Srini Devadas
#Please Do Break the Crystal
#This is an interactive procedure that given n floors and d balls determines
#what floors to drop the balls from to minimize the worst-case number of
#drops required to determine the hardness coefficient of the crystal.
#The hardness coefficient will range from 0 (breaks at Floor 1) or n (does not
#break at n.

#Exercise 1: It is possible that d is too large in that setting the first digit
#to 1 exceeds the number of floors. Shrink d prior to running the algorithm.
